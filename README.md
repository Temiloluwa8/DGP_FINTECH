## RECOMMENDATION
   Based on the insights from the dashboard, here are some recommendations for DIGIPENG:
+ Improve Failed Transactions
Channels like POS and Web recorded more failed transactions. The company should investigate technical or user issues and optimize these platforms.
+ Focus on Top Customer Segments
The 26–35 age group and Mobile App users are the most active. Marketing efforts and feature improvements should target these users.
+ Boost Agent & USSD Channels in High-Traffic Areas
Cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Ibadan show high transaction volumes. These areas should be prioritized for better agent support and service reliability.
+ Monitor Peak Periods
Since certain months show higher activity, DIGIPENG can prepare ahead with more system support or promotional offers during those times.
+ Encourage App Usage
Since the Mobile App has the highest success rate, DIGIPENG can promote app usage with incentives to reduce failed transactions on other channe
